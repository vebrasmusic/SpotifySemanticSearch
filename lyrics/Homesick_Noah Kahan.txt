27 ContributorsHomesick Lyrics[Verse 1]
Two months since you got back
How have you been and are you bored yet?
The weather ain't been bad
If you're into masochistic bullshit
And every photograph
That's taken here is from the summer
Some guy won Olympic gold
Eight years ago, a distance runner
And that makes a lot of sense
This place is such great motivation
For anyone tryna move
The fuck away from hibernation
Yoo-hoo
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'm tired of dirt roads
Named after high school friends' grandfathers
And motherfuckers here
Still don't know they caught the Boston bombers
Timе moves so damn slow
I swear I feel my organs failing
I stopped caring 'bout a month ago
Sincе then it's been smooth sailing

I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in
I'm homesick
I'm homesick
I'm homesick
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in
I'm homesick
I'm homesick
I'm homesick
I'm homesick
