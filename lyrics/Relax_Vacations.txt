8 ContributorsRelax Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're stressing out, over nothing real
So tell me what it's about, tell me what you feel

[Chorus]
Relax
Take it easy, lie down next to me
Forget your worries

[Verse 2]
You have the time you need, there will be tomorrow
So don't believe what you read, 'cause everything will follow

[Chorus]
Relax
Take it easy, lie down next to me
Forget your worriesYou might also like3Embed
