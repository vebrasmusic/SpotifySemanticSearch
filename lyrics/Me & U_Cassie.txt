[Verse 1]
You've been waiting so long, I'm here to answer your call
I know that I shouldn't have had you waiting at all
I've been so busy, but I've been thinking 'bout
What I wanna do with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know them other guys, they've been talking 'bout the way I do what I do
They heard I was good, they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, now it's me and you

[Chorus]
It's me and you now, uh, I've been waiting (Waiting)
Think I wanna make that move now
Baby, tell me if you like it (Tell me if you like it)
It's me and you now, uh, I've been waiting
Think I wanna make that move now (Gonna make that move now)
Baby, tell me how you like it

[Verse 2]
I was waiting for you to tell me you were ready
I know what to do, if only you would let me
As long as you're cool with it I'll treat you right
Here is where you wanna be
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

Get you right where you like it, I promise you'll like it (I swear)

It's me and you now, uh, I've been waiting
I've been waiting for your love, I've been waiting
Think I wanna make that move now
Gonna make a move now
