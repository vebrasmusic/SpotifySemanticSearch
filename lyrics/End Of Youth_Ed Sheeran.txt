I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there

[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth

[Verse 2]
I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near
When I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear

It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there

[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there

[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low
[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youthEmbed
