10 ContributorsFreaking Out The Neighborhood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sorry, mama
There are times I get carried away
Please, don't worry
Next time I'm home, I'll still be the same

[Chorus]
And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood

[Verse 2]
Really, I'm fine
Never been better, got no job on the line
Sincerely, don't worry
Same old boy that you hoped you would find

[Chorus]
And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhoodSee Mac DeMarco LiveGet tickets as low as $129You might also like1Embed
