7 ContributorsTRUCK BED Lyrics[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
She said, "Don't come home if you go to the bar"
I said, "Okay, baby" then got drunk out in the yard
2 AM I knock knock knocked up on the door
But she never unlock-locked it, guess I don't live there no more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, she meant business this time
I can't believe my bloodshot eyes

[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)

I used that empty bag of corn to rest my head
A camo jacket for a blanket then passed out like I was dead

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Still got one heck of a buzz
If I look a train wreck it's because

[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yeah
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yes I did

[Bridge]
I can't believe I gotta be at work at nine
That fuckin' bird's about to catch this .45
Oh, I guess if this really is goodbye (Ha)
At least I took my boots off this time, uh

[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserveEmbed
