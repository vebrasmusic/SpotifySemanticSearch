Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightnin' bugs
Are floatin' on the breeze
Baby get ready

[Verse 2]
Across the field where the crick turns back
By the old stone road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby get ready
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

[Verse 3]
Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
The days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along
Baby get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night
Baby get ready
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with

[Chorus]
You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
(You and me goin' fishin' in the dark)
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
(Down by the river in the full moonlight)
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
(We'll be fallin' in love)
Just movin' slow
[Chorus]
You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
(You and me goin' fishin' in the dark)
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
(Down by the river in the full moonlight)
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
(We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night)
Just movin' slow1Embed
