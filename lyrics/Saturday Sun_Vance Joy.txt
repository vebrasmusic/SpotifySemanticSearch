Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

[Verse 1]
So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She felt like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's goin' on?
'Cause I've been undone

[Pre-Chorus]
The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba

[Verse 2]
And still the memory's right there
She put the breeze in my hair
No kiss was softer, softer than this
I'm readin' her lips, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Each line I read
She left her books in my bed
And her song in my head
I've been undone
[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba

[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Oh, Saturday Sun
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost, oh Saturday Sun
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
I met someone
Oh, Saturday Sun
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
