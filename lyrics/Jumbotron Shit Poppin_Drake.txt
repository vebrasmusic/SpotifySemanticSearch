(Wake up, F1LTHY)
Yeah

[Chorus]
We ain't even out in Turks, she finna take sand
Ridin' 'round with F&N, we like to hold hands
(Oogie Mane he killed it) Boat was too sipped out, he ain't leave the bed
Damn, they dipped a pint of TEC in a Code Red
If I tell this bitch to pull up, she gon' moped it
My dawg, he don't smoke on shit unless it's unleaded
I don't back and forth over no 'net, so just go on, dead it
See me when you see me, if it's smoke, dawg, you unleash it

[Verse]
Thick Moroccan bitch, this my fav', I'ma go on and beat it
Lookin' in the mirror, kiss my face, I'm too conceited
Send a girl home, call another, dawg, I'm too slime
She ain't wanna eat it on her first day, it's haram
I don't fuck with drugs, poppin' X for the first time
That shit kicked in like a two-time world champ
Booted up, that shit hit up and downs like a skate-ramp
She vapin' in my room, that shit lit up like a glow-lamp
Who want smoke? Okay, cool, it's they whole camp
Big shit popper, we the ones that get your shirt damp
Niggas try to take a nigga spot and now it's too cramped
Up, 8AM, geekin' hard, I'm a real vamp
These niggas got me fucked up, dawg, I'm too amped
Hmm-hmm, make this bitch lick me like a mail stamp
Hmm-hmm, strapped up, fuck it, I'ma die lit
Too slime, posted at the crib in a snake pit
Every time I tell you how I feel, I don't fake shit
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr (Bih)
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, okay
Everybody got a stick, we don't run fades
