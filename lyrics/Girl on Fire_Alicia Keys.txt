57 ContributorsGirl On Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy
Lonely like a highway
She's livin' in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe
But she knows she can fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burnin' it down
Oh-oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backin' down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire
This girl is on fire

[Verse 2]
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls, say

Oh-oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burnin' it down
Oh-oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not comin' down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

[Bridge]
(Oh) Everybody stares as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lightin' up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
She's just a girl and she's on fire53Embed
