BackOutsideBoyz, totin' a seventy on the strip, I’m ready to die (Die)
Cuttin' the traction, bendin' the corner, bet I make shit glide (Shh)
Tried to bring the drama to me, he ain’t know how we cha-cha slide (Yeah)
I'll never lose sleep over no bitch, way too much pride (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fill it up in a briefcase, split this shit with the vibes (Yeah, yeah, hm, hm, hm)

[Verse 1: Drake & Lil Yachty]
Breakin' a Brink's truck, my right wrist Van Cleef (Cleef)
I spent days in the East tryna figure if I'm geeked ('Kay)
This bitch tweakin', talked too much while I was geeked, blew my peep (Brr)
Fuckin' rap niggas’ hoes, I’m on the street, this shit sweet (Hey)
I went half a million on rosé, did four million on my ice (Hey, hey)
Couple million on my cars, I went Tyson, I'm too nice (Hey, hey)
Nigga stopped me on the street, wanted to talk, so he asked my price (Yeah, hey, ’kay)
The number was high as me, I ain't gon' lie (Yeah, okay)
I was fuckin' with this lil’ woe, I think she bi (Bi)
Tweakin', the 6 God is comin' back (Brr)

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Yachty]
BackOutsideBoyz, totin' a seventy on the strip, I'm ready to die (Okay)
Cuttin' the traction, bendin' the corner, bet I make shit glide (Hm)
Tried to bring the drama to me, he ain't know how we cha-cha slide (Hm, slide)
I'll never lose sleep over no bitch, way too much pride (Brr, brr)
Fill it up in a briefcase, split this shit with the vibes (Hm, hm, uh, hm, hm, let's go)
