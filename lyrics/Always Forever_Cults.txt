39 ContributorsAlways Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me always forever
Say you'll stay, never be severed

[Chorus]
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

[Verse 2]
You and me always forever
We can stay alone together
Heard you say things could be better
Darling, don't get away right now

[Chorus]
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

[Bridge]
Oh, darling, it's alarming to think of us apart
You might also like[Chorus]
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

You and me always forever
We can stay alone together
You and me always forever
We can stay alone together

You and me always forever
We can stay alone together
You and me always forever
We can stay alone together23Embed
