Lookin' back
Lookin' back at the past
And what we had, oh-oh
And I hate the fact
We can't turn back 'cause what I did
It hurt you bad, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I did you wrong
Know that I led you on
Know that I did you wrong
(Did you wrong, did you wrong)
But I was runnin' blind
And I wish I took the time
To really ask you how you feel
So tell me now

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
How will I know?
How will I know?

[Post-Chorus]
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?

Every night
I'm runnin' wild to heal the scars
And clear my mind, oh yeah
But it's hard to find
The space I need to contemplate
That you're not mine anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I did you wrong
Know that I led you on
Know that I did you wrong
(Did you wrong, did you wrong)
But I was runnin' blind
And I wish I took the time
To really ask you how you feel
So tell me now

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?

[Post-Chorus]
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
[Bridge]
Oh, can you tell me?
I need to know, I need to know
How will I know if you really love me?
How will I know?
How will I know?

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet (Oh yeah)
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?1Embed
