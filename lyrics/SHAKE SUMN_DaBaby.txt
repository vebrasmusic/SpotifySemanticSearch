(He's on—, he's on—, he's on fire)
Yeah, call the fireman, she a hot girl
Come shake some, bitch

I don't know how to dance but can lean
And make the ghetto bitches put they hands on they knees (Ah)
I make the ghetto bitches put they hands on they knees (Ah)
I make the ghetto bitches put they hands on they knees (Yeah)
I don't know how to dance but can lean
And make the ghetto bitches put they hands on they knees (Ah)
I make the ghеtto bitches put they hands on they knees (Yеah)
Make the ghetto bitches put they hands on they knees

[Verse]
Yeah, call the fireman, she a hot girl, put her out
Ooh, I just broke a sweat in this bitch, get a towel
She said, "Nothin' been happenin' now, it's a drought"
I tell her put her ass in the air, dick her down (Ooh)
Go get in timeout, you a baddie (Ooh)
Just sent me a spot with the addy (Ooh)
I get up and pop me a Addy (Uh-huh)
I get up and pop me a Addy (Mm-hmm)
I get up and catch me a flight
The shit took 'bout four hours, went out to Cali (Mhm)
And it don't matter how much she say it
It still ain't now way she can make me her daddy
