2 ContributorsZIG ZAGGING Lyrics[Intro]
Fat drum, fat drum
Fat drum, hey
Fat drum, fat drum
Fat drum, fat drum

[Chorus]
Zig zagging
Running for cover in my brand new jacket
Ain't had it on me, I don't know what happened
And wonder "What if I meet light flashing?"
"Black sadness?"
Still zagging
Infatuated with all of this madness
The loaded .30 underneath my mattress
Can't bust if I just don't have it
Can't bust if a nigga don't –

[Verse]
Think things done got too hot to hold 'em
Can't shake it even with commotion
Must be in deep to think I had to phone you
Fucking my karma on a bed of roses
Getting paid to ride it like you stole it
Shit changing and you shifting focus
Souls break and most will never notice
Change shape, adopt a different motive
Now you running back to the black
What was that, double back to the same old problem
You talking bout I can't see the half and it's breaking your back but you can't go solve 'em now
You live every day as your last and you ride with some fire
Heavy thing in your lap 'cause something coming and it ain't that far
Something coming and it ain't that far
It ain't that far

Zig zagging
Running for cover in my brand new jacket
Ain't had it on me, I don't know what happened
And wonder "What if I meet light flashing?"
"Black sadness?"
Still zagging
Infatuated with all of this madness
The loaded .30 underneath my mattress
Can't bust if I just don't have it
Can't bust if a nigga don't –Embed
