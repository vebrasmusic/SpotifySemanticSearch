Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

[Verse 2]
You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long 'til I called you mine
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

[Chorus]
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get what I want
Since you been gone

[Verse 3]
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
How come I'd never hear you say, "I just wanna be with you"?
Guess you never felt that way

[Chorus]
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get, I get what I want
Since you been gone

[Bridge]
You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

[Chorus]
Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get, I get what I want
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get, I get what I want
[Outro]
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
