9 ContributorsLaid Back Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy, free my members, free all of 'em
Ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy
That's how that shit go, though, we gon'—
We gon' steady keep runnin' to them racks
Keep makin' these niggas mad
Make these niggas feel this shit every time we do somethin'
These niggas— These niggas be fucked up out here

[Chorus]
Ayy, I'm laid back in my own lane
I got niggas mad as a ho 'cuz I jumped in the game and spit propane
He better run when I let the 4-0 bang
Bro in the cell said no names
Stay down in the 4, wherе I'm from, bitch, it's gon' rain
I done got scarred, I can feel me somе more pain
Gon' sign a deal, bust it down with the whole gang
Ayy, ayy, my lil' bro and 'em on criminal time
Niggas hoes, I ain't feelin' them guys
Come and spark and get rid of them guys
Out the love, I can get 'em to slide
Know they fake, I can feel out the vibe
They ain't 'round, I ain't gotta remind it
Play 'em close, but I know they ain't silent
Louis bag, put a bag inside it

Ayy, I went, hit the block at, like, fifteen
I was just a young nigga with big dreams
Roddy Ricch, I was tryna go get cream
Me and Crank tryna see what the lick read
I had to take a few losses, I'm okay
Niggas hating on niggas, that's so gay
I get pot and won't stir you the wrong way
Walked through and I'm smoother than Olay
I can't front a nigga shit, he gon' run off
I'll die 'fore I ever take somethin' off
4 Nick hit his top, bet it come off
After twelve, all silent and guns off
Now I walk on the stage, bitches screaming
And all of my partners, they still on commando
Hellcat, wrap it up with some camo
Gun store, we don't run out of ammo
Gotta go do the show if the price right
She gon' fuck me and suck me, it's night-night
And she know I got something she might like
Take her home and I beat it, Fight Night
I'm a vet, bitch, I'm far from a new dude
Really having more clips than YouTube
I ain't even blew yet 'cause it's too soon
How the fuck niggas sleepin'? That's too rude
[Chorus]
Ayy, I'm laid back in my own lane
I got niggas mad as a ho 'cuz I jumped in the game and spit propane
He better run when I let the 4-0 bang
Bro in the cell said no names
Stay down in the 4, where I'm from, bitch, it's gon' rain
I done got scarred, I can feel me some more pain
Gon' sign a deal, bust it down with the whole gang
Ayy, ayy, my lil' bro and 'em on criminal time
Niggas hoes, I ain't feelin' them guys
Come and spark and get rid of them guys
Out the love, I can get 'em to slide
Know they fake, I can feel out the vibe
They ain't 'round, I ain't gotta remind it
Play 'em close, but I know they ain't silent
Louis bag, put a bag inside it

[Verse 2]
Don't let a nigga convince you can't
I'ma take all my shit to the bank
When you real, gotta look for the fake
Made a promise to mama, I'm great
And to all of my people, we straight
I will never stop chasin' ciabatta
Tryna slide, should of came with a doctor
Quick to shoot, I was made for the drama
Big Glock, bitch, I came for the problems
All on, I ain't takin' advice
Life a gamble, I'm shakin' the dice
Lose your head tryna reach for this ice
Remember way back when we got kicked out?
Tryna beef off of hoes, you tripped out
I be still thankin' God I got picked out
Glock .19 with thirty, it stick out
Sticks out, make the opps go vacate
Shell catches, we hit 'em with trey eight
In the red zone, still tryna play safe
I done came here from nothin' to great cake
Stick 'em up, make 'em dance, Nae Nae
Tryna slide on a nigga like playin' Skate
On the block like Craig and Day Day
Love all my partners, I tell 'em to stay safe
[Chorus]
Ayy, I'm laid back in my own lane
I got niggas mad as a ho 'cuz I jumped in the game and spit propane
He better run when I let the 4-0 bang
Bro in the cell said no names
Stay down in the 4, where I'm from, bitch, it's gon' rain
I done got scarred, I can feel me some more pain
Gon' sign a deal, bust it down with the whole gang
Ayy, ayy, my lil' bro and 'em on criminal time
Niggas hoes, I ain't feelin' them guys
Come and spark and get rid of them guys
Out the love, I can get 'em to slide
Know they fake, I can feel out the vibe
They ain't 'round, I ain't gotta remind it
Play 'em close, but I know they ain't silent
Louis bag, put a bag inside it

[Outro]
Put a bag in it (Huh? Huh? Huh?)
I put a bag in it (Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?)
Put a bag in it (Huh? Huh? Huh? Ayy, ayy)
Bitch, I put a bag in it
I'm from the 4 and I came with it
Got a Louis V duffel with cash in it2Embed
