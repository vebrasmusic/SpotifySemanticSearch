9 Contributors5 Foot 9 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jack makes good whiskey, yeah
Red dirt makes good riding roads
Country makes good music
For kickin' up dust in a taillight glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
And that's all good but for me

[Chorus]
God makes
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
Woah-oh, oh-oh, God makes the good stuff

[Verse 2]
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes

[Chorus]
God makes
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
You might also like[Bridge]
God made her so I'ma make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me
When He made

[Chorus]
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
5 foot 9, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff (Woah-oh, oh-oh)

[Outro]
Yeah, God makes the good stuff
Yeah, God makes the good stuff (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
Woah, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohEmbed
