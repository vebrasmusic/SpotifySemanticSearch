I hate that S-Class Benz that you're so damn proud of
You hate my truck 'cause you can't climb out of it
And I'll admit it girl, I said it and I meant it
Yeah, I loved you for a minute, but we damn sure different
It's been a week since you went and hit the highway
And made it clear that I oughta have it my way
But my way looks a whole lot better
With just my truck in the driveway

[Chorus]
And I hope you find you a high rollin'
High rise view that you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy with some dollar sign eyes
And a pocket full of money
And it ain't that I want you to think that I hate every single little thing you do
But when you say that I ain't ever gonna find nobody just like you
I hope that's true

[Verse 2]
You got drunk one night and told me I was white trash
I was high but I guess I wasn't high class
Enough to show up with you on your arm
We were never gonna be two kids on a farm

[Chorus]
And I hope you find you a high rollin'
High rise view that you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy with some dollar sign eyes
And a pocket full of money
And it ain't that I want you to think that I hate every single little thing you do
But when you say that I ain't ever gonna find nobody just like you
I hope that's true

I could sit here bitter and bitchin'
And wishin' things woulda gone different
But that don't sound nothin' like me at all
Honey, who the hell am I kiddin'?

[Chorus]
And I hope you find you a high rollin'
High rise view that you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy with some dollar sign eyes
And a pocket full of money
And it ain't that I want you to think that I hate every single little thing you do
But when you say that I ain't ever gonna find nobody just like you
I hope that's true

[Outro]
Yeah, I hope that's true
Oh, I hope that's true
I hope that's trueEmbed
