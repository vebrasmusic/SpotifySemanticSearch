[Verse 1: Flowdan]
Run for dem life when I step into the jungle
Said they wanna group up, they better move up

And when I come through, you know what I love do
I send shots for your team and leader
I make a witness decide to vacate
The war's gettin' sweet just like a Ribena

Yo, listen, you hear that?
Killers in the jungle
